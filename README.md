# Analytics Cup 2024 - LLMeals Recipe Recommendation Project

Welcome to the LLMeals Analytics Cup 2024 project repository! In this competition, LLMeals is addressing the challenge of high customer turnover rate after the trial period by developing a predictive model for recipe suggestions based on user preferences. This README provides an overview of the project, its goals, and the datasets used.

## Project Overview

**Problem Statement**: LLMeals, a start-up specializing in large language models for recipe suggestions, experienced a high customer turnover rate after the trial period. A survey revealed that although users perceived recipe quality as high, there was a mismatch with their specific requirements, such as dietary preferences and time constraints. To address this issue, LLMeals decided to develop a predictive model classifying recipes based on user preferences and created a user interface for filtering recipes by cooking time and macronutrients. The interface collected additional data on users' search behavior.

**Datasets**: The project leverages four key datasets:
1. **Recipes**: Contains a collection of recipes for analysis.
2. **Reviews**: Includes user reviews and feedback on recipes.
3. **Dietary Preferences**: Captures user dietary preferences and restrictions.
4. **User Requests**: Records user search behavior and preferences from the user interface.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to enhance the service quality provided by LLMeals by developing a predictive model for recipe suggestions that aligns better with user preferences. This will be achieved through the following objectives:

1. **Data Analysis**: Perform comprehensive data analysis on the provided datasets to understand patterns, user preferences, and recipe quality issues.

2. **Predictive Model**: Develop a predictive model that classifies recipes based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and other relevant factors.

3. **User Interface Enhancement**: Implement improvements in the user interface to allow users to filter recipes by cooking time and macronutrients.

4. **Data Collection**: Continue collecting data on users' search behavior through the interface to generate additional training data for recipe suggestions.
