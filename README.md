Analytics Cup 2024


In this year's Analytics Cup, LLMeals, a start-up specializing in large language models for recipe suggestions, faced a high customer turnover rate after the trial period. A survey revealed that although users perceived recipe quality as high, there was a mismatch with their specific requirements, such as dietary preferences and time constraints. To address this, LLMeals decided to develop a predictive model classifying recipes based on user preferences and created a user interface for filtering recipes by cooking time and macronutrients. The interface collected additional data on users' search behavior. Four datasets, including recipes, reviews, dietary preferences, and user requests, are leveraged to develop the model. The goal is to enhance service quality by generating additional training data for recipe suggestions.
